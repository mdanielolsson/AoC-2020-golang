# AoC 2020

This is my attempt to complete the [AoC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) in golang.

I will not spend too much time to make the code perfect and bullet proof but rather focus on the solutions and things that I think I need to work on to become better at the language.

If time allows I may come back at some time to improve.
